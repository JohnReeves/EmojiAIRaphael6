Find and open your JSFiddle link from last week - as we're going to add random mutations to our emojis!

#2. Global Variables

Mutations are an incredibly small chance of something "different" from the parents genetics happen - this is how evolution slowly works.

Firstly, we need to create ourselves a random variable to hold the chance of something random happening. Global variables go at the top of the page. I'm going to give my emojis a 2% chance of mutating like this:

```js
var mutationChance = 2;
```

My code looks like this:

#3. Genetic Algorithm

We can then go back into our `breedEmojis` function and take a look at the chance of each attribute being taken from the parentA or parentB.

Because we're calculating chance as a percentage (1 to 100) - we can add an if to check if the percentage is less than our mutationChance like this:

```js
if(fillChance < mutationChance){
  //mutate!
} else if (fillChance < 50){
  babyEmoji.fill = A_fill;
} else {
  babyEmoji.fill = B_fill;
}
```

We can then mutate that attribute by calculating an entirely random value, which is how we set up our original emojis:

```js
babyEmoji.fill =  fillColours[randomNumber(0, fillColours.length)];
```

You'll need to do this for all your properties that you want to mutate. You can also have a go at increasing the mutation rate by increasing the `mutationChance` variable.

My code looks like this:

#4. Finishing

This is the final worksheet - but you can always extend your project by adding more attributes to your emojis, different features they could all have!
