Global Variables\r\n\r\nMutations are an incredibly small chance of something \"different\" from the parents genetics happen - this is how evolution slowly works.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we need to create ourselves a random variable to hold the chance of something random happening. Global variables go at the top of the page. I'm going to give my emojis a 2% chance of mutating like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar mutationChance = 2;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy code looks like this:\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/faduH9s.png)\r\n\r\n#3. Genetic Algorithm\r\n\r\nWe can then go back into our `breedEmojis` function and take a look at the chance of each attribute being taken from the parentA or parentB.\r\n\r\nBecause we're calculating chance as a percentage (1 to 100) - we can add an if to check if the percentage is less than our mutationChance like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif(fillChance < mutationChance){\r\n  //mutate!\r\n} else if (fillChance < 50){\r\n  babyEmoji.fill = A_fill;\r\n} else {\r\n  babyEmoji.fill = B_fill;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can then mutate that attribute by calculating an entirely random value, which is how we set up our original emojis:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbabyEmoji.fill =  fillColours[randomNumber(0, fillColours.length)];\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll need to do this for all your properties that you want to mutate. You can also have a go at increasing the mutation rate by increasing the `mutationChance` variable.\r\n\r\nMy code looks like this:\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/4VCfphj.png)\r\n\r\n#4. Finishing\r\n\r\nThis is the final worksheet - but you can always extend your project by adding more attributes to your emojis, different features they could all have! \r\n\r\n:star: Don't forget to save your JSFiddle and send us your awesome project! :star2:\r\n\r\n",
